# Core Engineering Rules

## Context First
- DO NOT write code until you understand the system
- List files in target directory before changes
- Identify and follow existing patterns
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous

## Code Quality Standards

### Simplicity
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones
- Each function does one thing well
- Avoid premature optimization
- Implement what's needed now, not speculative features

### Error Handling
- Handle errors at function boundaries
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context

### Naming
- Names communicate purpose clearly
- Functions: verb_noun (get_user, validate_input)
- Variables: descriptive nouns (user_count, is_valid)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Match existing project conventions

### Comments
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Update comments when changing code
- Delete outdated comments

## Change Management

### Small Changes
- One logical change per commit
- Include related tests and docs
- Changes should be reviewable in <30 minutes

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Tests should fail when code breaks
- Cover edge cases and error paths
- Run existing tests before committing

### Documentation
- Update docs with code changes
- README for setup and overview
- Inline docs for complex logic

## AI Interaction

### Before Generating Code
1. Confirm understanding of requirements
2. Identify files that will be modified
3. Note patterns to follow from existing code

### When Generating Code
- Match existing code style exactly
- Use libraries already in the project
- Follow established folder structure
- Include appropriate error handling

### After Generating Code
- Verify no regressions in existing tests
- Confirm new code integrates properly
- Check for type errors and linting issues
